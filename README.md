# FirstUnityPrototype

## What is this?

This is the end result of the first unit of the Junior Programmer Pathway from ```learn.unity.com```. In this unit, we had to make a game where we control a car that has to dodge obstacles.

## Gameplay

Since this is a prototype, the gameplay is very rudimentary. The only game mode is multiplayer splitscreen. Despite the scope of the game being to dodge obstacles and reach the end of the road, there is neither a fail state nor an end goal programmed into the game. The user can simply drive the car into obstacles and jump off the map and the game will continue. In order to make it more interesting, lots of physics objects were placed on the road to ram into them and see how they fly.

## Controlls

The game is splitscreen, so we have two players. The car on the left side is controlled with WASD and the car on the right side with the arrow keys. Closing the game and opening it again is the only way to restart the game, and that can be done with Alt+F4. If the car is flipped or the user jumps of the map, the controlls will stop working for him.

## Building the game.

The game can be built by simply downloading the source code, opening it in Unity Hub, and using unity's utility to built the game for the desired platforms.
